## Easy Level

Q: What does docker save do?\
A: Saves an image to a tar file.

Q: What does docker load do?\
A: Loads an image from a tar file.

Q: What does docker export do?\
A: Exports a container’s filesystem as a tar archive.

Q: What’s the difference between export and save?\
A: Save exports images; export saves containers.

Q: What does docker import do?\
A: Imports an image from a tar file.

Q: Why export images?\
A: For sharing or backup.

Q: What’s a Docker registry?\
A: A repository for storing and distributing images.

Q: Can you tag images before export?\
A: Yes, using docker tag.

Q: What’s the file extension of exported images?\
A: .tar.

Q: How to verify if import was successful?\
A: Use docker images to check if image is listed.

## Moderate Level

Q: What command saves multiple images together?\
A: docker save -o filename.tar image1 image2.

Q: How to compress exported image?\
A: Use gzip or bzip2 with the tar file.

Q: Can you export running containers?\
A: Yes, but filesystem might be inconsistent.

Q: Why use docker tag before exporting?\
A: To label and identify the image version.

Q: How to transfer exported images between hosts?\
A: Use scp or any file transfer tool.

Q: What metadata is preserved in export vs save?\
A: docker save preserves image metadata, export does not.

Q: Can you re-import exported containers as new images?\
A: Yes, using docker import.

Q: What is docker history used for?\
A: To see image layers and commands used.

Q: Why not directly copy containers instead of exporting?\
A: Containers are runtime instances; images are portable.

Q: What’s the difference between docker push and save?\
A: Push uploads to registry, save creates local archive.

## Hard Level

Q: How can you migrate Docker images between servers offline?\
A: Save them as tar files and use docker load on target.

Q: Why is export slower for large images?\
A: It processes all filesystem data.

Q: What command removes dangling images?\
A: docker image prune.

Q: What happens if you export without tagging?\
A: The image gets an autogenerated ID tag.

Q: Can exported tar include multiple images?\
A: Yes, with docker save.

Q: Why might an imported image not run properly?\
A: Missing metadata or base layers.

Q: How to verify integrity of saved image files?\
A: Use checksums like sha256sum.

Q: Can Docker Compose use exported images?\
A: Yes, after loading them on all hosts.

Q: What is image digest?\
A: A unique SHA identifier for image versions.

Q: How does Docker layer caching affect exports?\
A: Cached layers reduce redundant storage and transfer time.
